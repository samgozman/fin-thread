		News context can be also related to some popular topics, we call it 'hashtags'.
		You only need to choose appropriate hashtag (0-3) only from this list: inflation, interestrates, crisis, unemployment, bankruptcy, dividends, IPO, debt, war, buybacks, fed, AI, crypto, bitcoin.
		It is OK if you don't find some tickers, markets or hashtags. It's also possible that you will find none.
		Next you need to create an informative, original 'text' based on the title and description.
		You need to write a 'text' that would be easy to read and understand, 1-2 sentences long.
